title: Entra
---

Microsofts cloud offering can be split into three main parts: The cloud provider [[notes/azure/index]], the productivity suite [[notes/m365/index]] and the identity provider Entra ID (formerly known as Azure Active Directory).

Entra can be connected to classic [[notes/ad/index|Active Directory]], but has no common technical base.

The APIs to interact with Entra are Microsoft Graph at [graph.microsoft.com](https://graph.microsoft.com) and the deprecated Azure Active Directory Graph at [graph.windows.net](https://graph.windows.net).
