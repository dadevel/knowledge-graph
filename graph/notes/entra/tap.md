An [[notes/entra/index]] Temporary Access Pass is a temporary password for an account.

If TAPs are enabled in Entra and you have the *Authentication Administrator* role you can assign TAPs to other users and login with the temporary password.
This does not alter the users original password and the resulting access token even contains the MFA claim.
