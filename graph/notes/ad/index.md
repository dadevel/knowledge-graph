Microsoft Active Directory (AD) is a directory service developed for [[notes/windows/index]] and hosted on-premise.
A domain contains user and computer accounts separated into Organizational Units (OU) while permissions are typically assigned to groups.
The Domain Controller (DC) runs core components like a LDAP server and Kerberos KDC.
